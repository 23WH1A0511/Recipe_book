**Recipe Book Management System – MERN Stack**

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Recipe Book Management System** is a full-stack web application developed using the **MERN stack** to digitally store, manage, and organize cooking recipes. The system allows users to view recipes, while an admin can add, update, and delete recipes.

This application helps users easily access recipe information such as ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time. It demonstrates real-world full-stack development using **React for frontend**, **Node.js and Express.js for backend**, and **MongoDB for database management**.
